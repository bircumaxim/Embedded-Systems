\subsection*{Conclusion}
In this laboratory work I've learned basic concepts of MCU
programming in C language and building a simple printed circuit using Proteus. I've implemented a simple counter and displayed it on a virtual terminal using UART and even if it was a simple program it was quite good for introduction to Embedded Systems world. It made me understand that I have a lot of work in feature cause , I've become very excited to study this filed.

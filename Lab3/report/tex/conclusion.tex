\subsection*{Conclusion}
In this laboratory work I've learned basic concepts of MCU
programming in C language and building a simple printed circuit using Proteus. I've implemented a driver for LM20 and using this driver I've did a small embedded system that get the temperature from LM20 and displays it in a virtual terminal and also on LCD.
